# Maps are assumed to have prime meridian at center, longitude 180 at edge, as is typical for Earth maps. Use longitude_offset if different.		
# For tidally locked moons, longitude 0 is the mean parent facing side.		
# If needed, longitude_offset can be used also to rotate models.		
# Model scale is assumed to be in meters (1 meter), unless included here.		
# Default values are hard-coded since we don't want to include all assets here.
